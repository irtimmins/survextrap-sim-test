## function to evaluate performance measures

## TODO
##
## Need function to list performances measures
## This could include Monte Carlo SE alongise measures  
##
## Need to first ensure that simulate_dgm can generate
## multiple simulated datasets perhaps.
##
## When we can simulate many datasets and store there
## results, can then use the output to evaluate
## performance such as bias, mse of parameters of interest
